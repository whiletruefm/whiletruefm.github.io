* [Copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright)
  * By "antithetical to the motivations of copyright," I meant that its true
    purpose, aside from getting authors paid, was more directly about
    consigning those writings into the public domain as texts for the public to
    collectively own. This is especially true of the American system, designed
    by people interested in that sharing of ideas, although the European system
    developed in a different way because the Berne Convention was drafted by
    authors like Victor Hugo.

* [Sojourner Truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sojourner_Truth)
  * Her speech ["Ain't I a Woman?"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ain%27t_I_a_Woman%3F) is an excellent example of an idea spreading via copying.

* Patch writing
  * [Assemblage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assemblage_(composition))
  * Google searches turned up a lot of articles that, rather than explaining what patch writing is, are moralistic screeds about plagiarism in general. This kinda proves my point: patchwriting is by definition putting something in your own words, yet it is considered as the same "offense" as directly copying words from a source for no reason other than a moralistic elitism in service of nothing.

* Right of attribution
  * Actually called "paternity" and is a feature of European-style [moral rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_rights).
  * In the United States, [*Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dastar_Corp._v._Twentieth_Century_Fox_Film_Corp.) determined that there is no attribution obligation for works that have passed into the public domain.
