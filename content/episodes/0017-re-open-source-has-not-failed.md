* Some people point to a case in the United States where a judge mentioned this
  theory in their opinion. That was dicta, not a holding, and that case was in
  Michigan, not Delaware. If it wasn't in Delaware, it's basically irrelevant
  when it comes to large corporations. Additionally, there is plenty of dicta in
  Deleware that says otherwise.
* Also, I forgot to mention that there are plenty of prominent corporations that
  have not yet turned profit even once and would be in big trouble if that were
  legally required. Tesla, anyone?
